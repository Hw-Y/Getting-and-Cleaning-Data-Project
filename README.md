# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
This is the project for Getting and Cleaning Data on coursera.
Open the run_analysis.R, and you will finally generate 3 .txt documents: Independent Data with Means, which is a table generated on
step 5. Merged Data generated on step 1, and Merged Data with Measurements on Means and Std based on requirements of step 3.
